VitaGuard is an AI tool that analyzes public social media posts to detect early signs of suicide risk using natural language processing and machine learning. It helps mental health professionals and support groups intervene faster.
Building AI course project

## Background

Suicide is a major global health issue and one of the leading causes of death among young people. Many express emotional distress online, but their signs go unnoticed.

This project aims to:

Detect suicide risk through public posts
Bridge the gap between online expression and timely support
Use AI ethically to save lives
Personal motivation: Mental health support often arrives too late. This tool aspires to use AI for proactive care and prevention.

## How is it used?

VitaGuard is integrated into the monitoring systems of mental health organizations, social media platforms, or NGOs. It continuously analyzes public posts, classifies risk levels, and notifies support networks if high-risk content is detected.

Users:

Mental health professionals
Crisis response organizations
Moderators on social platforms

It doesnâ€™t replace diagnosis by professionals
It cannot access private or encrypted content
Language, cultural, and ethical sensitivity are major concerns
Ethical concerns:

Data privacy and user consent
Risk of false positives and their consequences
Ensuring non-invasive intervention methods
## What next?
